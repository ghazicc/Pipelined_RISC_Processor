# Pipelined RISC Processor Design

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and verifying a simple pipelined RISC processor using Verilog, for educational purposes in **Computer Architecture**. The processor is built with a 5-stage pipeline and supports various instruction types and a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

## Objectives
- **Design** a 16-bit pipelined RISC processor with a 5-stage pipeline.
- **Implement** and simulate code sequences to verify the functionality of the processor.
- **Write a testbench** to test the processorâ€™s operations.

## Processor Specifications
- **Instruction and Word Size**: 16 bits
- **Registers**: 
  - 8 general-purpose registers (R0 to R7) where R0 is hardwired to 0.
  - A 16-bit Program Counter (PC).
- **Instruction Types**:
  - R-type (Register)
  - I-type (Immediate)
  - J-type (Jump)
  - S-type (Store)
- **Memory**:
  - Byte-addressable
  - Little-endian ordering
  - Separate instruction and data memory
- **ALU**: Handles arithmetic and logical operations, including condition signals (zero, carry, overflow).

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) & Opcodes
The processor supports the following instructions, categorized by their type and accompanied by their opcode values:

## Pipeline Stages
The processor operates in a 5-stage pipeline:
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve instruction from memory.
2. **Decode**: Decode instruction and read registers.
3. **Execute**: Perform ALU operations.
4. **Memory Access**: Access memory (load/store).
5. **Write Back**: Write result back to register.

## Verification & Testing
To verify the design:
1. Write test programs in the ISA.
2. Simulate the design using waveform diagrams.
3. Validate results using testbench.
